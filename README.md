## Background
**Context :**  
A company which is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists among people who successfully pass some courses which conduct by the company From this dataset, we assume if the course is free video learning. Many people signup for their training. Company wants to know which of these candidates are really wants to work for the company after training or looking for a new employment because it helps to reduce the cost and time as well as the quality of training or planning the courses and categorization of candidates. Information related to demographics, education, experience are in hands from candidates signup and enrollment. The source of this dataset is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes?select=audi.csv">Kaggle</a>.  

**Problem Statement :**  
Hiring process could be time and resource consuming if company targets all candidates only based on their training participation. Company wants to increase recruitment efficiency by knowing which candidates are looking for a job change in their career so they can be hired as data scientist. If company use old method, they need to offer all candidates and it will use more money and HR Departments have time limit too, they can't ask all candidates 1 by 1 and usually they will take random candidates. It still not efficient because people want to change job is less than not. So we need new method which can reduce cost (money and time) and make success probability increase to reduce CPH.

**Goals :**  
Reduce cost and increase probability candidate to be hired can make cost per hire decrease and recruitment process more efficient. To predict candidates who will change job or not, we can't use simple statistic and need machine learning so company can categorized candidates who are looking and not looking for a job change. In the end HR Department can have more option to recruit with same budget if compare with old method and also have more time to focus at candidate qualification and get the best candidates to company.

**Metric Evaluation :**    
Determine the suitable metric to rate the performance from the model
